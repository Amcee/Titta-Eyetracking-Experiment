Titta is a toolbox for using eye trackers from Tobii Pro AB with Python,
specifically offering integration with [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/). A Matlab version
that integrates with PsychToolbox is also available from
https://github.com/dcnieho/Titta

## To get started
To get started on Windows:
1. Download [PsychoPy (version 3.1.5 or higher](https://www.psychopy.org)
1. Download and install [git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Open the command window
	1. Go the the PsychoPy folder (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\PsychoPy3)
	1. type 'python -m pip install git+https://github.com/marcus-nystrom/Titta.git#egg=Titta' 
1. Download the 'examples' folder and run read_me.py (first change the monitor settings and the eye tracker name in read_me.py).
	
Alternatively:
1. Download [PsychoPy (version 3.1.5 or higher](https://www.psychopy.org)
1. Install websocket-client (for Tobii Pro Lab integration)
	1. Open the command window
	1. Go the the PsychoPy folder (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\PsychoPy3)
	1. type 'python -m pip install websocket-client
1. Download or clone the Titta folder
1. Add the downloaded Titta-folder to path in PsychoPy (under file->preferences)
1. Run read_me.py (first change the monitor settings and the eye tracker name in read_me.py).

Tested with PsychoPy v. 3.1.5 on Windows 10 using Python 3.6. Ideally, make sure that the eye tracker is detected and works in 
the [Tobii Eye Tracker Manager](https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/eye-tracker-manager/) before trying to use it with Titta.

## Contents
The toolbox consists of two main parts:
### The `Titta` class
The Titta class is the main workhorse of this toolbox, providing a wrapper around the Tobii Pro SDK, and a convenient graphical user interface (rendered through PsychoPy) for participant setup, calibration and validation. Only the `Titta.calibrate()` participant setup and calibration interface requires PsychoPy.
### The `TalkToProLab` class
The `TalkToProLab` class provides an implementation of [Tobii Pro Lab](https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/tobii-pro-lab/)'s External Presenter interface, allowing experiments to be created and run from Python with PsychoPy or other presentation methods, while recording, project management, recording playback/visualization and analysis can be performed in Tobii Pro Lab.
