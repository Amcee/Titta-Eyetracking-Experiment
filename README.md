`examples/read_me.py` shows a minimal example of using the toolbox's
functionality.

*Note* that this toolbox is in a beta state. The API may change drastically at any time without notice. Work is ongoing, and code may also be in a broken or untested state without warning. That said, the toolbox has already been used in several projects at the Lund University Humanities Lab, Sweden.

pip install git+https://github.com/marcus-nystrom/Titta.git#egg=Titta

Tested with PsychoPy v. 3.1.0 using Python 3.6 and Python 2.7.
